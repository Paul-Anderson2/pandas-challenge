Module 4 challenge.              
Written analysis of the data is contained in the word document, titled "Data Analysis of Pyschool Challenge," separately from the Jupyter Notebook code.  There is also a .txt file in case you are unable to view the word doc.          
Finished code is obviously located in the .ipynb file
